Got it ✅ — that error you’re seeing is a generic Vite runtime overlay error in Replit. Let me break it down for you:

🔍 What the Error Means

[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] (unknown runtime error) → Vite caught an error at runtime (in the browser).

sendError → Vite’s dev server is injecting the error overlay into your frontend.

The actual cause is usually:

A frontend JS/TS runtime bug (undefined variable, wrong API call, etc.).

API returning HTML (e.g. 404 page) instead of JSON, which your frontend tries to parse.

CORS/auth issue (backend rejecting request).

The overlay itself isn’t the bug — it’s just how Vite shows you the bug.

⚡ How to Fix / Debug Step-by-Step

Check your browser dev console (F12 → Console tab).

Look for the first red error above sendError. That’s the real cause.

Check Network tab.

See if an API call failed (401, 404, 500).

If your frontend expects JSON but got an HTML error page, you’ll see Unexpected token '<'....

Check your frontend code where you fetch data.

Example:

const res = await fetch("http://localhost:4000/api/teams");
const data = await res.json(); // ❌ will throw if res isn’t JSON


→ If backend sent an error page, this crashes.
✅ Fix: Check status before parsing.

if (!res.ok) {
  throw new Error(`API error ${res.status}`);
}
const data = await res.json();


Optional: If overlay annoys you but you still want errors logged, disable it in vite.config.js:

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    hmr: {
      overlay: false,
    },
  },
})


→ This just hides the overlay (not fixing the error).

✅ What You Should Do Now

Open browser dev tools → Console + Network tab.

Find the first red error (404? 500? SyntaxError?).

Share that with me → I’ll tell you the exact fix in your code or backend.

Do you want me to also give you a safe error handler template for your fetch calls so your app doesn’t crash even if backend misbehaves?

these error show when i try to click a dropdown ...is there different dropdown method that i can use ,so that these error do not occur
ChatGPT said:

Ah, thanks — that’s a key detail 👍
If the error only appears when you click a dropdown, then the problem is likely inside the dropdown component logic — not your backend API.

🔍 Why a Dropdown Can Crash in React/Vite

Uncontrolled state / undefined value

Example:

const [selected, setSelected] = useState<string>(); // undefined initially
<Dropdown value={selected} onChange={setSelected} />


If the dropdown expects a valid string, passing undefined may cause a runtime error.

Accessing undefined props

Example:

{options.map(o => <li>{o.label}</li>)} // if options = undefined → crash


Mismatched component library

Some dropdown components (Material UI, AntD, shadcn/ui, etc.) require specific props (value, onValueChange, etc.). If those are missing → runtime errors.

✅ Safer Dropdown Approaches

Here are two stable patterns you can switch to:

1. Plain HTML <select> (zero runtime errors)
const [role, setRole] = useState("batsman");

return (
  <select
    value={role}
    onChange={(e) => setRole(e.target.value)}
    className="border p-2 rounded"
  >
    <option value="batsman">Batsman</option>
    <option value="bowler">Bowler</option>
    <option value="allrounder">All-Rounder</option>
  </select>
);

2. shadcn/ui Select (modern & styled)
import {
  Select,
  SelectTrigger,
  SelectValue,
  SelectContent,
  SelectItem,
} from "@/components/ui/select";

const [role, setRole] = useState("batsman");

return (
  <Select value={role} onValueChange={setRole}>
    <SelectTrigger className="w-[200px]">
      <SelectValue placeholder="Select role" />
    </SelectTrigger>
    <SelectContent>
      <SelectItem value="batsman">Batsman</SelectItem>
      <SelectItem value="bowler">Bowler</SelectItem>
      <SelectItem value="allrounder">All-Rounder</SelectItem>
    </SelectContent>
  </Select>
);


This second approach prevents most runtime crashes since onValueChange always gives you a safe string.

👉 If you don’t want errors when someone clicks the dropdown, I’d recommend starting with <select>, then upgrading to shadcn/ui’s <Select> when you want styling.

Do you want me to give you a ready-made dropdown for “Batsman Type” and “Bowler Type” (Fast/Medium/Spin, Right/Left hand) that you can just plug in?

Got it 👍 — thanks for pasting the logs.

The message you’re seeing:

ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications.


is not a fatal error. It’s a browser warning that happens when layout changes are so frequent that the browser’s ResizeObserver can’t deliver all notifications in one cycle. It’s common when working with dropdowns, modals, or dynamically resizing components in React + Vite dev mode.

🔑 Key Points

✅ Your app is still working — this does not break functionality.

⚠️ It appears repeatedly when components resize fast (like opening/closing a dropdown, sidebar, or modal).

🛠️ Solutions are more about suppressing noise and avoiding layout thrashing.

🔧 Ways to Handle It

Ignore in development (safe, recommended)
Since it doesn’t crash your app, you can safely ignore these warnings during development.

Patch with requestAnimationFrame
If you’re building your own dropdown/modal with ResizeObserver, wrap the callback like this:

const observer = new ResizeObserver((entries) => {
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    for (let entry of entries) {
      console.log(entry.contentRect);
    }
  });
});


This avoids the “undelivered notifications” loop.

Switch dropdown implementation
If you’re using a custom dropdown that triggers continuous re-renders, consider swapping to:

Plain <select> (no ResizeObserver used)

shadcn/ui Select (well-optimized, minimal warnings)

HeadlessUI Listbox (stable, no ResizeObserver spam)

👉 My suggestion: since you’re seeing this after clicking a dropdown, the dropdown’s internal resize handler is the trigger. If you want to completely eliminate these warnings, I can give you a ready-made stable dropdown implementation (batsman/bowler type) using either <select> or shadcn/ui.

Would you like me to generate the copy-paste stable dropdown version now?

You can also disable this overlay by setting server.hmr.overlay to false in vite.config.js.


to resolve  this error i already set hrm overlay to fasle but the error is happending aggain
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "path";
import runtimeErrorOverlay from "@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    runtimeErrorOverlay(),
    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" &&
    process.env.REPL_ID !== undefined
      ? [
          await import("@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer").then((m) =>
            m.cartographer(),
          ),
        ]
      : []),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client", "src"),
      "@shared": path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "shared"),
      "@assets": path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "attached_assets"),

  server: {

      strict: true,
      deny: ["**/.*"],
    },
    hmr: {
      overlay: false,
    },
  }
});

Thanks for pasting your vite.config.ts 👌.

I see what’s happening here — you disabled the default Vite HMR overlay (hmr.overlay: false ✅), but you’re still using this line:

import runtimeErrorOverlay from "@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal";


That plugin forces its own runtime error modal overlay, which is exactly the one showing:

[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] (unknown runtime error)
Click outside, press Esc key, or fix the code to dismiss.


So disabling Vite’s overlay alone won’t stop it — because the Replit error modal plugin is separate.

🔧 Fix Options
✅ Option 1: Remove the runtime error overlay plugin

Just delete this line:

import runtimeErrorOverlay from "@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal";


And remove it from plugins: [...]:

plugins: [
  react(),
  // runtimeErrorOverlay(), ← remove this
  ...
],


This will stop the modal overlay completely.

✅ Option 2: Keep plugin, but silence overlay

Unfortunately, @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal doesn’t respect hmr.overlay: false. If you must keep it, wrap it in a condition:

...(process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? [] : [runtimeErrorOverlay()]),


That way, you get the overlay only in development, not always.

🔑 Recommendation

Since you already turned off Vite’s overlay, the simplest fix is: remove @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal if you don’t want overlays at all.
